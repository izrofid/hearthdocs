This article will cover some basic information about the game.

### Basics

Pokémon Hearth is meant to be a cozy adventure set in a brand new region. It is not a difficulty/qol hack. The difficulty level of the game is somewhat comparable to vanilla pokemon games. Currently the demo goes up to the third gym. The rest of the game is under development.

### The Toku Region
The Ancient China/Japan inspired Toku Region is the setting of Pokemon Hearth. Being set in the distant past compared to mainline pokemon games, a lot of the terminology is borrowed from Pokemon Legends Arceus. For instance, there are no Pokemon Trainers in Toku. The term used instead is Pokemon Wielder.

#### A Living, Breathing World
Hearth features a dynamic internally managed clock instead of the standard Realtime Clock (RTC) used in Pokemon games. This means the in-game time is not dependent on anything outside it. The player can sleep at Pokemon Refuges to pass time. The world of Hearth will react to the in-game clock as NPCs have different schedules. Some NPCs will only appear at night and vice-versa. For instance, Shamisen Players appear in Refuges at night while the School is only open during the day.

#### Gorgeous Custom Assets
Nearly every asset in Hearth is bespoke. Nearly every NPC has a custom mugshot. The maps and tilesets are made from scratch.

### Learnsets
Hearth uses the Pokemon XY Learnsets as a fallback for all pokemon who don't have custom learnsets. The custom learnsets are not yet documented.
